## Changes to the high-level business logic

Write here a high-level description of the changes this PR brings to the business logic (UI flows, backend logic, ...)

## Changes to the data model

Tip: use the diffs for back/db/schema.rb to keep track of the changes here. Explain the reason these changes were needed.

## Changes to the APIs

Keep in mind that breaking changes the web API are not allowed. Use an API versionning mechanism if you need to perform breaking
changes to an endpoint and preserve compatibility with the existing clients.

## Deployment notes

Write here the points that need specific attention when deploying: new environment variables that need to be configured on the
production environments, manual changes that need to be made to the database, verifications that need to be performed...

The fewer the better! Extra karma for you if you can write something in code instead of adding it here.
